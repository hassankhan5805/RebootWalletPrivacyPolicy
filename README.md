Privacy Policy for "Reboot Wallet" App

Effective Date: April 21, 2023

Capstone ("we", "us", "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information of users of our "Reboot Wallet" app (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information through our App.

Collection of Information

We do not collect any personal information from users of the App. The App automatically generates a wallet address for each user, which is stored on the blockchain. The App does not store or transmit any user data or personal information.

Use of Information

As the App does not collect any personal information from users, we do not use any information for any purpose.

Disclosure of Information

As the App does not collect any personal information from users, we do not disclose any information to any third party.

Security

The security of the App is largely dependent on the security of the underlying blockchain technology. Blockchain is considered to be a highly secure and tamper-proof system, which makes it a popular choice for storing and transferring digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of the App, including using encryption and other security technologies to protect the App and users' transactions.

However, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the App or the blockchain, and users should take appropriate measures to protect their own wallets and transactions, such as using strong passwords and following best practices for securing digital assets.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our privacy practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any material changes to this Policy by posting the updated Policy on our website or through other communication channels.
